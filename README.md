# cog-snap

### Status: starts; needs user testing

- installs using winetricks dotnet48
- intial window(s) are faintly visible, but some errors show up:
  - fixme:path:parse_url failed to parse L"Cog.XmlSerializers" (could be solved by seeding expected files?)
- uses winetricks vkd3d, but needs additional unzstd binary (apt pkg "zstd")
